			<h2>Resilient Coders</h2>
			<p>
				<a href="http://resilientcoders.org" title="Resilient Coders Program" target="_blank">Resilient Coders</a> is focused on making web technology more available to underserved youth. It's a <a href="http://resilientcoders.org/program" title="Resilient Coders Program" target="_blank">three-part program</a> that funnels students from learning HTML after school, through our downtown "Coworking" sessions, and ultimately, hourly employment. Our higher performers participate in <a href="http://resilientcoders.org/lab" title="Resilient Lab" target="_blank">Resilient Lab,</a> a web design and development shop with real clients.

		<div class="right45">
			<h2>Young People's Project</h2>
			<p><a href="http://typp.org" target="_blank" title="Young People's Project">YPP</a> uses Math Literacy Work to develop the abilities of elementary through high school students to succeed in school and in life, and in doing so involves them in efforts to eliminate institutional obstacles to their success.

          The Program

			<h2>The Sprint</h2>

Over the course of the week, students will learn enough HTML and CSS to each build his or her own website. They'll have help from Resilient Coders' youth mentors, and from professional developers as they learn by doing.

			<h2>Demo Day</h2>
			<p>
On Friday, April 24th, our young people will present to a room full of tech professionals. They will discuss what they've done, and what they hope to accomplish next.
